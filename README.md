Adjust this list to match actual features in the repo.

## Tech stack (assumptions)

I detected the site is hosted on Vercel (live domain). Common stacks for Vercel-hosted portfolios:

- Next.js (React) or Vite + React / plain static site
- Node.js / npm for build tools
- CSS / SCSS / Tailwind CSS for styling

If your project uses a different stack, update this section accordingly.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended >= 16)
- npm, Yarn or pnpm

### Local development
